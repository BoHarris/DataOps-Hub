#🔐 ALEX – PII Sentinel API
A real-time, machine learning-powered privacy scanner to detect and redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from structured datasets.

🚀 Key Features
📁 Upload CSVs and auto-detect sensitive data

🧠 Predict PII columns using an XGBoost classifier trained for high accuracy

✂️ Instantly redact sensitive fields using AI + regex pattern detection

🔎 Covers emails, SSNs, IPs, phone numbers, and more

🪪 Returns a risk score based on detected sensitivity

📊 Feature-rich ML pipeline with custom value-based and metadata engineering

🧰 Built-in CLI tools for terminal use cases

📦 Modular FastAPI setup for rapid integration

🧠 Model Performance
We’ve transitioned to XGBoost with expanded features and a cleaned dataset.

✅ Accuracy
Achieved ~99.7–100% accuracy on internal validation sets with class_weight="balanced"

Optimized for real-world columns using actual PII/non-PII structures

Performance tracked via confusion matrix & prediction heatmaps

📈 API Output (/predict)
Returns:

```
{
  "filename": "example.csv",
  "pii_columns": ["email", "ssn"],
  "risk_score": "67%",
  "redacted_file": "redacted/example.csv"
}
```
