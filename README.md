🚀 DataOps Hub: A Privacy-Conscious Data Processing Pipeline
```
DataOps Hub is a modular data processing pipeline built for transforming, aggregating, and exporting structured datasets — with a strong focus on clean, interpretable, and privacy-aware workflows.

This project simulates a real-world DataOps workflow by incorporating:
```
✅ Data ingestion and validation
```
🧹 Cleaning and normalization

📊 Feature transformation (e.g., age categorization)

📈 Data aggregation and export
```
📁 Structured output for downstream machine learning or analytics
```
🔧 Key Features
Automated ETL: End-to-end data processing from raw .csv to clean, enriched datasets

Privacy Sensitivity: Designed to pair with privacy-related ML tools (like your PII detection classifier)

Extensible Pipeline: Built with clarity and modularity for future integration with AI/ML or compliance checks

Logging-First Design: Real-time logging to trace every pipeline step and support audit readiness
```
📁 Output Structure
```
processed_train.csv: Cleaned, normalized dataset

aggregated_processed_train.csv: Grouped and summarized data for exploratory insights
```
💡 Use Cases
```
Preprocessing datasets for AI/ML privacy applications

Simulating compliance-friendly data engineering pipelines

Teaching or demonstrating privacy-aware data handling in healthcare or finance
